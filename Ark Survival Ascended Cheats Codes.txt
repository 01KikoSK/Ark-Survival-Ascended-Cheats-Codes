Enable Admin Commands: This depends on your platform. Generally, you'll need to enable admin rights during server creation or use a single-player mode with admin enabled.

Enter Commands: Type the desired console command and press Enter. Here are some examples:
 
god: Enables god mode (invulnerability)
